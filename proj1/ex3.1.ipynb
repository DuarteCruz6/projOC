    "Based on the graph and table, we can see that the average misses with arrays of size <= 32KB is small and constant. With an array of size 64KB, there is a noticeable jump in average misses, showing that the cache can no longer hold the entire array and cache evictions occur. Hence, we can assume that size of the L1 data cache is 32KB.\n",

    "From the graph and table, we can see that for an array of size = 64KB, which is bigger than the L1 cache size, up to stride = 32, the miss rate scales gradually, but at stride = 64, there is a sharp jump in average misses, meaning every access goes to a new line.\n",

    "\n",
    "To determine the associativity set size, we have to analyze in which stride the miss rate decreases back to zero for the largest cache (that is, red line 64KB). Because the stride determines how many distinct blocks of array data we're going to access, we know that for a stride of 2^15 (the maximum for this array size) we're only going to access 2 different blocks of this cache. If the cache is, at least, 2-way associative, we're going to have a near-zero miss rate.\n",
    "If we repeat this process for lower strides, we notice that for 2^14 and 2^13 the miss rate is also near-zero. This must mean the cache is, at least, 4-way or 8-way associative, respectively. For a lower stride of 2^12, this is no longer the case, so we must have surpassed the number of ways of our cache.\n",

    "From the graph, by observing the stride vs. average misses for an array of size = 512KB, which is bigger than the L2 cache size, we see that misses increase roughly linearly as the number of lines mapped to the same set increases, but then saturate around 4 misses per access.
